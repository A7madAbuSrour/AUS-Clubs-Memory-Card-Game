# AUS Clubs Memory Card Game Project

This repository contains the main assets for a simple Unity card-flipping memory game.

### 📁 What's Included

- `Scripts/` – All C# scripts used in the game logic (`.cs` files with `.meta` files)
- `FrontSprites/` – Club logo image, which is the front side of the cards (with `.meta` files)
- `FrontSprites/` – AUS web dev club logo, which is the back of the cards (with `.meta` file)
- `CardAudio/` – Card flipping sound effects (with `.meta` files)
- `Scenes/` – Unity scene files (with `.meta` files)

> 🔍 If you're just here to browse the code, you can open the `.cs` files directly in the `scripts/` folder.

### 🧩 Using the Scene in Your Own Unity Project

To use the scene(s) in your own Unity project:

1. Open your Unity project folder.
2. Copy the `Scenes/` folder from this repo into your project’s `Assets/` folder.
3. Unity will detect the `.unity` scene file and the `.meta` file.
4. Open Unity and go to **File > Open Scene**, then select the scene you imported.

> ✅ Keeping the `.meta` files ensures that all references and settings stay intact (e.g., GameObject links, audio, scripts).

### 💡 Tip

If you're cloning the whole repo to use as a Unity project:
- Place everything inside your own project's `Assets/` folder or replace your `Assets` with this one.
- Be sure to keep the folder structure and `.meta` files for Unity to work properly.
